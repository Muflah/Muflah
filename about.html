                <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>

                <p>
                    Soon after starting my career as an engineer I realized that something else that I'm good at is management.
                    Coordinationg with cross functional teams to get things work was something that I enjoyed.
                    I transitioned to product management with a simple thought, "let's make something big!"

                <h3>PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</h3>

                <p>
                    It's been half a decade I started working on products. Like most of us I started small.
                    The first product that I worked on was a rather simple inventory management system. The UI was never a priority but UX was something we would spend hours on.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Soon after I got a chance to work on a multitenant product for the food and catering industry with multiple clients for web and mobile platforms. It was big and we took a lot of time going back and forth with teh requirements.
                    The development had it's own issues. The architecture was designed by a remote team that added further complexity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that I faced was in teh form of a platform that enabled traciblity of inventory for coffee producers of Uganda.
                    The first time I worked on an enterprise level product. It used to be a lot of work, we would spend a lot of hours talking to the clients and farmers that often talked in a  different language.
                    We started the development with simple requirements but very soon it turned into a network of untangled userflows.
                    The other challenge was hardware integration. Access to the hardware that clients' wanted to use was limited and we would often wait for days to get it shipped.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the project that I was assigned with and that turned into a product was an app for social media marketing and automation.
                    I was responsible for onbording the team, gathering requirement, and start the development of the MVP.
