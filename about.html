                <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>

                <p>
                    Soon after starting my career as an engineer I realized that something else that I'm good at is management.
                    Coordinationg with cross functional teams to get things work was something that I enjoyed.
                    I transitioned to product management with a simple thought, "let's make something big!"

                <h3>PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</h3>

                <p>
                    It's been half a decade I started working on products and as of now it's the major part of my career. Like most of us I started small.
                    The first product that I worked on was a rather simple inventory management system. The UI was never a priority but UX was something we would spend hours on.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Soon after I got a chance to work on a multitenant product for the food and catering industry with multiple clients for web and mobile platforms. It was big and we took a lot of time going back and forth with teh requirements.
                    The development had it's own issues. The architecture was designed by a remote team that added further complexity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that I faced was in teh form of a platform that enabled traciblity of inventory for coffee producers of Uganda.
                    The first time I worked on an enterprise level product. It used to be a lot of work, we would spend a lot of hours talking to the clients and farmers that often talked in a  different language.
                    We started the development with simple requirements but very soon it turned into a network of untangled userflows.
                    The other challenge was hardware integration. Access to the hardware that clients' wanted to use was limited and we would often wait for days to get it shipped.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the project that I was assigned with and that later turned into a product was an app for social media marketing and automation.
                    I was responsible for onbording the team, gathering requirement, and start the development of the MVP.

                <h3>AGILE PROCESSES & WORKFLOWS</h3>

                <p>
                    A big chunk of a product manager's day is spent with teams and stake holders to ensure smooth operations.
                    The expectation is to make the most out of available resources while maintaining a certain level of quality.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I was introduced to traditional project management early in my career and soon after that I got to experiance Agile.
                    While working with startups adn small to mid-sized teams I was expected to impliment Agile processes and workflows.
                    After multiple experiances I have learned a few things that come handy and help me manage better.
