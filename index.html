                            <p>
                                Switching to product management has been one of the biggest decisions of my life—one that made very little sense when I started.
                                Soon after beginning my career as an engineer, I realized there was something else I could do effortlessly: delivering products.
                                Coordinating with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to get things working was something I was naturally good at—and so it began.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike engineering, which I studied and earned a license to practice, project management is something I learned on the go.
                                I'm one of those who learned the craft by doing, with very little initial knowledge of how things worked.

                                <p>
                                    It's been half a decade since I started working on products, and it’s now the major part of my career.
                                    So far, I’ve delivered and worked on a variety of products and enterprise platforms.

                                    After multiple experiences with startups and small to mid-sized teams, I’ve learned a few things that help me manage better.
                                    I'm actively sharing that knowledge with anyone looking to improve and scale.
