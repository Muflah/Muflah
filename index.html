                            <p>
                                Switching to product management has been one of the biggest decisions of my life that made very little sense when I started.
                                Soon after starting my career as an engineer I realized something else that I was able to do efforlessly and it was delivering products.
                                Coordinationg with cross functional teams and stakeholders to get things work was something that I was naturally good at and so it begun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Opposed to engineering, that I studied and got license to work as, project management is something that I learned on the go.
                                I'm one of those who learned the craft by doing with very little knowledge of how things work.

                                <p>
                                    It's been half a decade I started working on products and as of now it's the major part of my career.
                                    So far I have delivered and worked on a bunch of products and enterprise platforms.

                                <p>
                                    After multiple experiances with startups and small to mid-sized teams I have learned a few things that help me manage better.
                                    I'm actively trying to share that knowledge with anyone that might be looking for ways to improve and scale.
